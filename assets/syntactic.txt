Note: Types of relative clauses:
1. Defining clauses (Restrictive clauses)
A defining (restrictive) clause is one that is essential to the sense of the sentence.
My house that has a blue door needs painting.
Here the blue door is a defining characteristic, it helps to distinguish that house from my other houses.
Defining clauses or phrases are not separated off with commas. A restrictive clause or phrase is essential to the meaning of the sentence;
it defines the word it modifies by ›restricting‹ its meaning. Eliminating a restrictive element from a sentence changes its meaning dramatically.
2. Non-defining clauses (Non-restrictive clauses)
A non-defining (non-restrictive) clause is one that can be regarded as parenthetical:
My house, which has a blue door, needs painting.
My car, which I have had since I was a teenager, was stolen last night.
She gave me her number, which I wrote on a piece of paper.
His dad, who is 78, goes for a 5 mile walk everyday.
Use commas to set off non-defining elements, which contribute to, but do not determine, the meaning of the sentence.
These elements may be clauses (groups of words that contain a subject and a verb) or
phrases (groups of words that do not contain both a subject and a verb).
Tip:
Note that defining (restrictive) and non-defining (non-restrictive) clauses must be introduced by the appropriate relative pronoun (who, which, that, whose).
Defining (restrictive) clauses should NEVER be set off with commas and non-defining (non-restrictive) clauses ALWAYS should.
NEVER use “that” with a non-defining clause.#

PRAGMATIC CHALLENGES
    1- Avoid contractions; they are informal in academic writing. 

Example: It doesn´t matter
Correction:  It does not matter

    2- The title is the first thing the readers look at. Thus, make sure you call their attention so that they are eager to read your ideas. 

    3- Pay attention to the audience you are writing to; the level of formality changes. 
EXAMPLE: (when writing to a friend) Hi Pal! What’s up?
(when writing to your boss) Good afternoon Mr. Jhonson, how are you? 

    4- Use the correct person (first, second, third)  depending on the type of text you are writing. 
EXAMPLE
    • you should follow the next steps (sentence in a process paragraph/essay)
    • we must take care of water ( sentence in a persuasive paragraph/essay)
    • People who believe in euthanasia are crazy (sentence in an argumentative paragraph/essay) 



















SEMANTIC CHALLENGES
    1- Some words resemble the Spanish language but they differ in meaning. These words are called false cognates. 

Example:  Actually, depression is becoming a huge problem in our society. 
Correction: Nowadays, depression is becoming a huge problem in our society. 
NOTE # 1: Actually means in fact, truly. 
NOTE # 2: Some synonyms or close words you can use instead of nowadays are: currently, recently, in recent times, today, lately, now. 
    2- Look for another word; this one does not fit with the correct meaning. 

Example: I lost the exam. 
Possible Correction: I failed the exam.



    3- Avoid redundancy in meaning.

Example: If all of us cooperate together, we will succeed.
Correction: If all of us cooperate (or work together), we will succeed.
NOTE #1: In this sentence, the words cooperate and together have been used; but these words convey the same meaning.

    7- Be careful when using adjectives ending in ED / ING because they totally change the meaning of your sentence.

Example: Steve is embarrassed/ Steve is embarrassing. 
NOTE # 1: Adjectives ending in -ed describe emotions while adjectives ending in -ing describe a characteristic of something or someone. 
    8- Another and other are used in different ways. Other is an adjective meaning 'different' and it is used with both, singular and plural nouns; another expresses quantity, something extra or additional and it is used with singular nouns only. 
Example: Have the other cup of tea, not this cup/Have another cup of tea, not just this one. 
    9- Coherence is the unifying element in good writing. It is what gives a piece of writing its flow. When writing lacks coherence, the reader is forced to stop and reread. Organize your ideas, please.
